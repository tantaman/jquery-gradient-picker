Gradient Picker
====

A jQuery plugin to allow you to add gradient choosers to your website.

* The type of gradient (radial, linear) is configurable as well as the fill direction of the gradient.
* Currently works in Webkit, Mozilla and Opera.  **Support for IE may be coming in a future version.**
* Control points can be added by clicking on the gradient preview
* Control points may be removed by clicking the "x" on that control point's color configuration
* The colors of individual control points may be assigned


Options
====

* ```fillDirection``` default: left.  Can be any CSS3 supported direction for linear gradients.  E.g., top, left, bottom, right, 45deg, etc.  

* ```type``` default: linear.  Options: linear or radial

* ```controlPoints``` color and position pairs used to set the initial state of the gradient picker.  Written in the following form: ```controlPoints: ["green 0%", "orange 100%"]```

* ```change``` the callback to call when the gradient has been updated / changed.  Callbacks receive two parameters: ```points``` and ```styles```.  ```points``` contains the information for each gradient control point.  ```styles``` contains the generate CSS.  The first entry in the styles array is the CSS3 standard style.  The second entry is the browser specific style (-moz,-webkit,-o,etc.)

* ```generateStyles``` default: true.  Option to not generate styles and instead only pass back the ```points``` array.
